				<p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>


				<p>I'm excited to be applying for the {{ proposal.tools }} position at {{ proposal.customer }}. I have spent most of my life working with startups and am able to fill many roles simultaneously while still meeting deadlines and delivering exceptional quality. As a junior Ruby on Rails coder with a Masters in Accounting and 7 years working as a Project Manager, QA Manager and Onboarding Manager for the same company, designing a program that is truly helpful to both internal and external users is my ultimate goal on every project. I am delighted by the opportunity to apply my knowledge at {{ proposal.customer }} as I truly enjoy working with small teams. Feel free to checkout my Github repositories <a href="{{ proposal.portfolio_url }}">here</a>.</p>


				<p>In my current role at MyTime, I provide support for all areas of the company. I developed two separate apps that help multiple departments save many hours of manual work on a daily basis. I am also the only agile project manager in the company and have been for 2 years, so I handle every major project including mid to enterprise level merchant pilots or launches, some as large as 200+ locations in 6 weeks, the conversion of all Twilio numbers to 10DLC A2P messaging services and custom development scoping, planning and tracking. Another major contribution was the development of the entire customer onboarding process from the ground up, which I now manage with 3 onboarding specialists that report to me, effectively reducing early churn by over 50%. I also built and now manage the QA team with 5 analysts that have reduced both the time needed for new features to reach production and the number of defects that come with those features. Finally, I lead the documentation team and have started a weekly changelog and a daily, as needed, database changelog to provide transparency to our merchants.</p>


				<p>Aside from my role with MyTime, I contribute to open source projects, do volunteer freelance coding projects for non-profit organizations, and work with my coding mentor as an intern to develop my coding skills in an environment with a shorter development lifecycle.</p>


				<p>Thank you for your time and consideration. I'm looking forward to learning more about the {{ proposal.tools }} position and about {{ proposal.customer }}. As a Software Developer, my goal is to continually increase my programming skills in order to present better solutions to my employers and their clients. I look forward to learning how I can work with the team at {{ proposal.customer }} to realize our goals together.</p>


				<p>Sincerely,</p>


				<p>Alisha M. Taylor</p>
